<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>From Tamaulipas, the northeasternmost state in the Mexican Republic,
146 kinds of mammals, belonging to 72 genera, are here reported.
Mammals that are strictly marine in habit are not included. The state
is crossed in its middle by the Tropic of Cancer. Elevations vary from
sea level on the Golfo de México to more than 2700 meters in the Sierra
Madre Oriental; most of the state is below 300 meters in elevation. Its
area is 79,602 square kilometers (30,732 square miles).</p>

<p>Tamaulipas, meaning "lugar en que hay montes altos" (place of high
mountains), was explored in 1516 by the Spaniard Francisco Fernández de
Córdoba, but it was not until the 18th century that José de Escandón
established several villages in the new province of Nueva Santender
from which, in the time of Iturbide's Empire, Tamaulipas was separated
as a distinct political entity, with about the same boundaries that it
now has.</p>

<p>My first contact with the state of Tamaulipas, as a mammalogist, was in
1957, when in company with Dr. Bernardo Villa R. I visited the Cueva
del Abra in the southern part of the state. On several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> occasions since
then I have been in the state, especially when employed by the
Dirección General de Caza of the Mexican Government. In 1960-1962 I had
the opportunity of studying the mammalian fauna of Tamaulipas at the
Museum of Natural History of the University of Kansas. The
approximately 2000 specimens there represent many critical localities,
but are not sufficient to make this report as complete as could be
desired. Consequently the following account should be considered as a
contribution to the knowledge of the mammals of México and is offered
in the hope that it will stimulate future studies of the Mexican fauna,
especially that of the eastern region.</p>
<hr class="chap" />



<h2><a name="PHYSIOGRAPHY" id="PHYSIOGRAPHY"></a>PHYSIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>Tamaulipas can be divided into three physiographic regions, which from
east to west are Gulf Coastal Plain, Sierra Madre Oriental, and Central
Plateau or Mexican Plateau (<a href="#fig1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>).</p>


<h3>Gulf Coastal Plain</h3>

<p>This physiographic region covers most of the state and extends
northward into Texas and a short distance southward into Veracruz.</p>

<p>According to Tamayo (1949) and Vivo (1953), the Gulf Coastal Plain is
formed by sedimentary rocks from Mesozoic to Pleistocene in age. The
most common type of soil is Rendzin, especially in the coastal area.
Elevations range from sea level to 300 meters. The area is in general a
flat plain inclined to the sea but this plain is broken by several
small sierras. The more important of these are the Sierra de
Tamaulipas, which rises to more than 1000 meters, and the Sierra San
Carlos, which has a maximum elevation of approximately 1670 meters. The
Sierra de San José de las Rucias is smaller.</p>


<h3>Sierra Madre Oriental</h3>

<p>This physiographic region is represented in Tamaulipas by a small part
of the long Sierra Madre Oriental that extends from the Big Bend area
in Texas southward to the Trans-volcanic Belt of central México. The
Sierra Madre Oriental is in the southwestern part of Tamaulipas. The
Sierra was formed by folding of the Middle and Upper Cretaceous and
Cenozoic deposits that now are 400 to 2700 meters in elevation. In
general, the soils are Chernozems.</p>

<p>This physiographic region is situated between the other two
physiographic regions in Tamaulipas and represents a barrier to the
distribution of some tropical mammals on the one hand and to those from
the Mexican Plateau on the other.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> Three physiographic regions: 1 Coastal Plain;
2&nbsp;Sierra Madre Oriental; 3 Central Plateau.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<h3>Central Plateau</h3>

<p>This physiographic region, commonly termed the Mexican Plateau,
occupies only a small area of Tamaulipas in its southwesternmost part.
The plateau is approximately 900 meters above sea level. In general,
the Mexican Plateau was formed by Cretaceous sediments. The most common
type of soil is Chestnut.</p>
<hr class="chap" />



<h2><a name="CLIMATE" id="CLIMATE"></a>CLIMATE</h2>


<p>Owing to the differences in elevations and varying distances from the
sea, the climate of Tamaulipas is varied. Tamayo (1949), following the
Koeppen System, assigned to Tamaulipas 10 different climate types that
result principally from differences in temperature, precipitation, and
humidity.</p>


<h3>Temperature</h3>

<p>The annual mean temperature for the lands less than 1000 meters in
elevation, which make up most of the state, is between 20° and 25° C.;
and the difference in monthly means is 5° C.</p>

<p>In the areas above 1000 meters, the annual mean is between 15° and 20°
C., and the difference in the monthly means is 15° C.</p>

<p>The maximum temperature recorded in the state is 45° C. in the region
of Ciudad Victoria, between the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Sierra San
Carlos, and the Sierra de Tamaulipas. Minima recorded are between O°
and 5° C. on the southeastern coast, O° to -5° C. between 98° 20´ long.
and 99° 00´ long., and -5° to -10° C. in the Sierra Madre Oriental.</p>


<h3>Precipitation</h3>

<p>Rainfall varies seasonally and can be described as follows: In January
it amounts to 25 to 50 mm. in the coastal region and 10 to 25 mm. in
the rest of the state. In April there is more than 25 mm. to the north
of about 23° north latitude, 10 to 25 mm. in the Sierra de Tamaulipas
and Sierra Madre Oriental, and less than 10 mm. in the extreme
southwestern part of the state.</p>

<p>In July rainfall amounts to less than 25 mm. in Nuevo Laredo and San
Fernando, is from 25 to 50 mm. in the northeastern and central parts of
the state, 50 to 100 mm. in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra Madre
Oriental, and 100 to 200 mm. in the area south of Soto la Marina and
east of the Sierra Madre Oriental. In October rainfall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span> is less than 50
mm. in the northern half of the state, including the Sierra de
Tamaulipas, and 50 to 100 mm. in the rest of the state, except on the
east side of the Sierra Madre Oriental and in the area near Tampico,
which receive between 100 and 200 mm.</p>

<p>The number of rainy days per year varies from 60 to 90 at Sierra San
Carlos, Sierra Madre Oriental, and in the lowlands south of 23° north
latitude; the rest of the state has about 60 rainy days, excepting the
Mexican Plateau, which has fewer than 60.</p>

<p>Although Tamayo (1949) followed the Koeppen System in classifying types
of climate and thereby recognized 10 different kinds of climate in
Tamaulipas, these can be grouped into three major categories as
follows:</p>


<h3>Steppe Dry Climate (Clima Seco de Estepa)</h3>

<p>This kind of climate can be divided into two categories based on the
average annual temperature.</p>


<h4><i>Warm</i></h4>

<p>The average annual temperature exceeds 18° C. but the mean of the
coolest month is less than 18° C. This sub-climate is characterized by
a short rainy season in summer and occurs on the west side of the
southern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental and on the Mexican Plateau;
it occurs also in the area northwest of Reynosa and on the east side of
the Sierra Madre Oriental but in these areas the rainfall is
irregularly distributed in the year.</p>


<h4><i>Cool</i></h4>

<p>The average annual temperature is less than 18° C. but the mean of the
warmest month exceeds 18° C. This sub-climate occurs only on the west
side of the northern part of the Sierra Madre Oriental.</p>


<h3>Moderate Rainy Temperature Climate<br />
(Clima Templado Moderato Lluvioso)</h3>

<p>This type of climate is characterized by the coolest month having a
temperature of between -3° and 18° C. In the northeastern and central
parts of Tamaulipas, including the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Ciudad
Victoria, Gómez Farías, Rancho Pano Ayuctle, and Llera, the average
temperature of the warmest month is less than 22° C.; the winters are
dry and not rigorous, and the wettest month has ten times as much rain
as the driest. In the Sierra San Carlos the average temperature of the
warmest month is less than 22° C., and the rainy season is in the
autumn.</p>

<h3>Tropical Rainy Climate (Clima Tropical Lluvioso)</h3>

<p>This climate is characterized by the average temperature of all months
being above 18° C. and the mean-annual rainfall being above 75 cm.
According to the distribution of precipitation this type of climate can
be divided into: (1) areas having periodic rain and wet winters
(southeastern Tamaulipas, south of 22° north latitude and east of 99°
west longitude), and (2) areas having an irregular rainy season and dry
winters (area around Ciudad Mante, between 99° 30´ and 98° 30´ west
longitude and south of 22° 30´ north latitude).</p>

<p>Owing to the differences in climate from one region to another, the
flora and fauna also differ, especially in the southern part of the
state as compared with the northern part.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>For expressing the taxonomic resemblance of mammalian faunas
having nearly equal numbers of taxa, Burt (1959:139)
recommended the following formula: C&nbsp;×&nbsp;100/(N<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;N<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;-&nbsp;C)
(where C is the number of taxa common to the two faunas,
N<sub>1</sub> is the number of taxa in the smaller fauna, and N<sub>2</sub>
is the number of taxa in the larger fauna). For non-flying
mammals the resemblance of the Tamaulipan fauna to that of
Texas, adjacent to the north, and Veracruz, adjacent to the
south, is as follows:</p>

<p>For all of the land mammals of Tamaulipas, the resemblance
is as follows:</p>

<p>On the whole, the fauna of Tamaulipas resembles faunas of both the
Brazilian Subregion and the North American part of the Nearctic
Subregion (see Hershkovitz, 1958:611). Considering the 48 genera of
non-flying land mammals of Tamaulipas, 24 genera occur in habitats from
the North American part through habitats of northern México into the
Brazilian Subregion. Of the remaining 24 genera, 16 occur in the North
American part of the Nearctic Subregion or in it and the part of
northern México north of the Brazilian boundary, whereas eight occur in
the Brazilian Subregion or in it and the northern part of México. None
occurs only in Tamaulipas or only in northern México.</p>

<p>The non-flying fauna of the coastal plain east of the Sierra Madre
Oriental and south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la Marina is
mainly tropical in affinities; only 27 per cent of that fauna (at the
subspecific level) resembles the fauna north of Soto la Marina, which
is Nearctic in its affinities. The fauna of the Sierra de Tamaulipas
has a greater taxonomic resemblance (20.4 per cent at subspecific
level) to that of the Sierra Madre Oriental, than does the fauna of the
Sierra San Carlos (17.6 per cent). Taxonomic resemblance between the
faunas from the Sierra San Carlos and the Sierra de Tamaulipas amounts
to only 16.1 per cent. Therefore, the faunas of these two Sierras (both
are included in the same zoogeographic unit) resemble each other less
than either resembles the fauna of the Sierra Madre Oriental (in
another zoogeographic unit). Of the three sierran faunas, those of the
Sierra Madre Oriental and the Sierra de Tamaulipas have most in common.
Migration from one to the other in relative recent time may account for
the resemblance. The Sierra San Carlos may have been isolated for a
long time and interchange between its fauna and those of the other two
sierras, therefore, may have been slight.</p>

<p>Study of the taxonomic resemblance shows that the dividing line, in
eastern México, between Nearctic and Neotropical faunas is along the
eastern base of the Sierra Madre Oriental, the southern base of the
Sierra de Tamaulipas and thence to the coast at or near Soto la Marina.</p>

<p>Merriam (1898) assigned to Tamaulipas four Life-zones. There were:
Transitional on the highest elevations of the Sierra Madre;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span> Upper
Austral at lower elevations on the Sierra Madre; Lower Austral over
most of the state; and Tropical in the coastal areas.</p>

<p>Dice (1943) outlined Biotic Provinces on a map of North America and in
the northern part of Tamaulipas showed two Biotic Provinces, Tamaulipan
and Potosian. He did not show the southeastern limits of the Chihuahuan
Biotic Province nor any of the limits of the Veracruzian Biotic
Province and in text mentioned nothing about the limits of these two
provinces with reference to Tamaulipas. Later, Goldman and Moore (1946)
divided Tamaulipas in three Biotic Provinces: Tamaulipas, Sierra Madre,
and Veracruz. Still later (1949), Smith published a map of Mexican
Biotic Provinces based on the herpetofauna of the Republic. He divided
Tamaulipas among four Provinces. Two were Nearctic (Austro-oriental and
Tamaulipan) and the other two were Neotropical (Veracruzian and
Cordoban).</p>

<p>Leopold (1950 and 1959) recognized five principal vegetational types in
Tamaulipas as follows: Mesquite-grassland; Pine-oak Forest; Thorn
Forest; Tropical Deciduous Forest; and Desert.</p>

<p>For dealing with the mammals of Tamaulipas in the following accounts
the four Biotic Provinces (Tamaulipan, Potosian, Veracruzian, and
Chihuahuan) of Dice are the most useful. For dealing with types of
vegetation in the accounts that follow, Leopold's (1950) system is
employed although reference is made to other associations and
formations that have been reported in Tamaulipas.</p>


<h3>Tamaulipan Biotic Province</h3>

<p>This Province is recognized by most authors who have written about the
zoogeography of México. It is the most extensive in the state and
includes the northern part of the Coastal Plain (see <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>The vegetation of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province is in general
Mesquite-grassland but in the Sierra San Carlos and Sierra de
Tamaulipas other types of vegetation are found.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Two formations occur in the Mesquite-grassland. The first is
the Mesquite Scrub, in which the dominant plant is the
mesquite (<i>Prosopis juliflora</i>), associated with <i>Cordia
boissieri</i>, several species of <i>Acacia</i>, and in some areas
with <i>Opuntia</i> and <i>Yucca treculeana</i>. The dominant grasses
are of the genera <i>Bouteloua</i> and <i>Andropogon</i>. The second
formation is the Gulf Bluestem Prairie, where species of
<i>Andropogon</i> are the dominants on the well-drained sites.
Sloughs and depressions are occupied by cordgrass, <i>Spartina
spartinae</i>. Many areas have been invaded by mesquite and
other shrubs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Around the Sierra de Tamaulipas and in the area between it
and the Sierra San Carlos the vegetation is Thorn Forest
(Tropical Thorn Forest of Martin <i>et al.</i>, 1954), in which
the dominant plants are <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Ichthyomethia</i>, <i>Ipomea</i>,
<i>Prosopis</i>, and <i>Cassia</i>. Another type of vegetation in the
Sierra de Tamaulipas is the Tropical Deciduous Forest at 300
to 700 meters elevation, the trees of which are 20 meters
high with a canopy averaging eight meters high (Martin <i>et
al.</i>, <i>op. cit.</i>). The common species of trees belong to the
genera <i>Tabebuia</i>, <i>Ipomea</i>, <i>Bombax</i>, and <i>Conzattia</i>.
Species of <i>Bursera</i>, <i>Acacia</i>, and <i>Cassia</i> are less
abundant. In the low canyons <i>Bursera</i>, <i>Ceiba</i>, and
<i>Psidium</i>, draped with lianas and various epiphytes, can be
found.</p>

<p>The Pine-oak Formation grows above an elevation of 800
meters in the Sierra de Tamaulipas and is characterized by
<i>Pinus cembroides</i>, <i>P. nelsonii</i>, <i>P. teocote</i>, and
<i>Quercus arizonica</i>. Martin <i>et al.</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>) recorded
Montane Scrub from the dry areas, between elevations of 600
and 900 meters. That scrub is formed by huisaches (<i>Acacia
farnesiana</i>) along with a few oaks and some trees of the
Tropical Deciduous Forest.</p>

<p>The vegetation of the Sierra San Carlos was studied by Dice
(1937) and divided into three life belts, each with several
associations. For more information about the plants of each
association and their related mammals see the publication of
the mentioned author.</p>

<p>Endemic mammals of the Tamaulipan Biotic Province, in the
part of it that is in Tamaulipas, are the following:
<i>Scalopus inflatus</i>; <i>Lepus californicus curti</i>;
<i>Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus</i>; <i>Cratogeomys castanops
tamaulipensis</i>; <i>Dipodomys ordii parvabullatus</i>; and
<i>Sigmodon hispidus solus</i>. Other characteristic mammals of
this Province in the state of Tamaulipas are: <i>Sylvilagus
floridanus connectens</i>; <i>S. audubonii parvulus</i>; <i>Lepus
californicus merriami</i>; <i>Perognathus merriami merriami</i>;
<i>Dipodomys ordii compactus</i>; <i>Orzomys melanotis carrorum</i>;
<i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens intermedius</i>; <i>Peromyscus boylii
ambiguus</i>; <i>Canis latrans texensis</i>; <i>C. l. microdon</i>; <i>C.
lupus monstrabilis</i>; <i>Taxidea taxus berlandieri</i>; <i>Mephitis
mephitis varians</i>; <i>Felis pardalis albescens</i>; <i>Trichechus
manatus latirostris</i>; and <i>Odocoileus virginianus texanus</i>.</p>

<p>Many other kinds of mammals occur mainly in the Tamaulipan
Province but are not listed above because they occur also in
one or more of the other provinces.</p>

<p>The Sierra de Tamaulipas is placed in the Tamaulipan Biotic
Province because the fauna, especially of non-flying
mammals, is closely related to that of the rest of the
Province. Nevertheless, many mammals found in this Sierra
are tropical in relationship. This is especially true of the
bats. Therefore, most of the tropical bats that occur in
Tamaulipas occur in the Veracruzian Biotic Province and in
the Sierra de Tamaulipas.</p>
</div>


<h3>Potosian Biotic Province</h3>

<p>This Province occupies all of the Sierra Madre Oriental and, therefore,
the southwestern part of the state.</p>

<p>The vegetation in general is Pine-oak Forest, in which the most common
trees are <i>Abies religiosa</i>, <i>Pinus flexilis</i>, <i>P. patula</i>, <i>P.
montezumae</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> <i>P. teocote</i>, <i>Populus tremuloides</i>, <i>Juniperus
flaccida</i>, <i>Quercus arizonica</i>, <i>Q. clivicola</i> and <i>Q. polymorpha</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In his study of plants of the Gómez Farías area, Martin
(1958) recorded several different types of vegetation, which
in part can be placed in the Potosian Biotic Province,
especially those types that occur to the northwest of the
Cloud Forest. In addition to the Cloud Forest, Martin
recognized Humid Pine-oak Forest, Dry Oak-pine Forest,
Chaparral, Thorn Forest and Scrub, and Thorn Desert.</p>

<p>The only mammal endemic to the Potosian Province in
Tamaulipas is <i>Cryptotis pergracilis pueblensis</i>. Other
mammals that occur mainly in this Province are: <i>Sorex
saussurei</i>; <i>Notiosorex crawfordi</i>; <i>Glaucomys volans
herreranus</i>; <i>Cratogeomys castanops planifrons</i>;
<i>Perognathus nelsoni</i>; <i>Liomys irroratus alleni</i>;
<i>Reithrodontomys fulvescens griseoflavus</i>; <i>Microtus
mexicanus subsimus</i>; <i>Ursus americanus eremicus</i>; <i>Conepatus
leuconotus texensis</i>; and <i>Odocoileus hemionus</i>.</p>

<p>The fauna of this Province is a mixture of elements with
tropical affinities on the east side of the Sierra Madre and
with those of the Mexican Plateau on the west side.</p>
</div>


<h3>Chihuahuan Biotic Province</h3>

<p>This Province occurs in Tamaulipas only in a small portion of the
Central Plateau physiographic region and occupies the southwesternmost
part of the state.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The vegetation is of two types: Desert or
Mesquite-grassland. The last is like that described for the
Tamaulipan Biotic Province. In the Desert type the dominant
plants are the cactus, <i>Opuntia leptocaulis</i>, and yuccas,
<i>Yucca filifera</i> and <i>Y. potosina</i>. Subdominants are
mariola, guayule, <i>Agave lechugilla</i>, <i>A. stricta</i> or
<i>Larrea divaricata</i>. Along stream banks mesquite, <i>Prosopis
juliflora</i>, can be found.</p>

<p>No endemic mammals of the Chihuahuan Province are known in
Tamaulipas. Mammals that occur principally in this Province
are: <i>Dipodomys merriami atronasus</i>; <i>D. ordii durranti</i>;
<i>Peromyscus melanophrys consobrinus</i>; <i>P. difficilis
petricola</i>; <i>Onychomys torridus subrufus</i>; and <i>Neotoma
albigula subsolana</i>.</p></div>


<h3>Veracruzian Biotic Province</h3>

<p>This Province includes the southern part of the Coastal Plain
physiographic region, south of the Sierra de Tamaulipas and Soto la
Marina. But the exact line between this Province and the Tamaulipan
Province to the north is difficult to draw. The northern boundary of
the Veracruzian Province is the line between the Nearctic and
Neotropical regions in eastern México.</p>

<p>Vegetation of most of the Veracruzian Biotic Province is Tropical
Deciduous Forest. This Forest is made up of <i>Tabebuia</i>, <i>Ipomea</i>,
<i>Bombax</i>, and <i>Conzattia</i>, along with some <i>Ceiba</i>, <i>Bursera</i>, and
<i>Psidium</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The mammalia fauna of the Veracruzian Biotic Province is
tropical in nature. This is especially true of the bats.
Representatives of the tropical genera <i>Micronycteris</i>,
<i>Sturnira</i>, <i>Artibeus</i>, <i>Enchistenes</i>, <i>Desmodus</i>,
<i>Diphylla</i>, and <i>Molossus</i> have their northern
distributional limits in this Province. The non-flying
mammals characteristic of the Province in Tamaulipas are:
<i>Philander opossum pallidus</i>; <i>Marmosa mexicana</i>; <i>Ateles
geoffroyi velerosus</i>; <i>Geomys tropicalis</i>; <i>Oryzomys

<h2><a name="BARRIERS_AND_ROUTES_OF_MOVEMENT" id="BARRIERS_AND_ROUTES_OF_MOVEMENT"></a>BARRIERS AND ROUTES OF MOVEMENT</h2>


<p>The distributional patterns and affinities of the mammalian fauna of
Tamaulipas suggest possible routes of migration and barriers that
limited or controlled movements of the mammals.</p>

<p>Mammals may have reached Tamaulipas by way of a Northern route, a
Trans-plateau route, a Montane route, or a Tropical route (<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>).</p>

<p>The Northern route permitted species of mammals from the temperate
region to the north to enter the Tamaulipan Biotic Province from or via
Texas. Several came from the Great Plains, and a few came from the
eastern part of the United States. Also, a few mammals that may have
originated in the Tamaulipan Province moved northwards. Some of these,
according to Dice (1937:267) were <i>Liomys irroratus texensis</i>,
<i>Peromyscus leucopus texensis</i>, and <i>Lepus californicus merriami</i>.
Other mammals thought to have moved north by this route are <i>Didelphis
marsupialis</i>, <i>Dasypus novemcinctus</i>, <i>Oryzomys palustris</i>, <i>Nasua
narica</i>, and <i>Tayassu tajacu</i>. Some mammals that passed through
Tamaulipas into Texas have extended their geographic ranges far north
of Texas.</p>

<p>Mammals that came <i>via</i> the Trans-plateau route (name proposed by
Baker, 1956:146) came no farther into Tamaulipas than the Chihuahuan
Biotic Province. They encountered the barrier formed by the Sierra
Madre Oriental. These mammals were listed in the account of the
Chihuahuan Biotic Province.</p>

<p>The route that Baker (1956:146) termed the "Southern Route" I here term
the Montane route because I think it was used for movement southward as
well as northward.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">
<a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a>
<img src="images/i_003.png" width="434" height="600" alt="Fig. 3. Routes of movement: 1 Northern; 2 Trans-Plateau;
3 Montane; 4 Tropical." title="Fig. 3. Routes of movement: 1 Northern; 2 Trans-Plateau;
3 Montane; 4 Tropical."/>
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span> Routes of movement: 1 Northern; 2 Trans-Plateau;
3&nbsp;Montane; 4 Tropical.</span>
</div>

<p>The Montane route was used by mammals of boreal affinities (<i>Microtus</i>
and <i>Neotoma</i>), that moved into Tamaulipas from the north; also in this
category are bats of the family Vespertilionidae. For movement from
south to north, the route was used by several species native to México,
for example, <i>Cratogeomys castanops</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span> seaward slope of the montane
area has enabled some tropical mammals to move farther north than they
have done at higher and lower elevations. <i>Philander opossum</i> seems to
be an example.</p>

<p>The fourth route, the Tropical one, was used by mammals of tropical
origin. Most moved into Tamaulipas only as far as the Veracruzian
Biotic Province. The principal mammals that have used this route are
the bats and marsupials, but <i>Sylvilagus brasiliensis</i>, <i>Ateles
geoffroyi</i>, <i>Heterogeomys hispidus</i>, <i>Eira barbara</i>, and <i>Mazama
americana</i> also can be included here. Some tropical mammals, as was
pointed out previously, not only reached Tamaulipas but have moved
through the state and far northward.</p>

<p>The major barriers to dispersal of mammals in Tamaulipas are three (see
<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). Two of them, the Río Grande Barrier and the Sierra Madre
Barrier, are physiographical, but the Tropical Barrier is maintained by
a combination of environmental factors. The three barriers separate the
four Biotic Provinces in Tamaulipas. The Sierra Madre Oriental, which
forms the Potosian Biotic Province, lies between the Tamaulipan and
Chihuahuan provinces. The Tropical barrier separates the Tamaulipan and
Veracruzian biotic provinces.</p>

<p>The Río Grande, as was pointed out by R. H. Baker (1956:146), has low
banks, is relatively shallow, and does not form an effective barrier
for most mammals. For only two species, insofar as I know, has the Río
Grande constituted a barrier. <i>Cratogeomys castanops</i> has not entered
southeastern Texas from México, and <i>Spermophilus spilosoma</i> has not
entered México from southeastern Texas except on the coastal barrier
beach. Alvarez (1962:124) postulated that the beach was the route by
which <i>S. spilosoma</i> arrived at La Pesca where the barrier beach meets
the mainland.</p>

<p>The Sierra Madre Barrier is a good filter for some small mammals,
especially for those that occur on the Mexican Plateau and those of
tropical origin. The mammals that occur on each side of the Sierra are
listed in accounts of the Chihuahuan (west side), Veracruzian and
Tamaulipan (east side) biotic provinces.</p>

<p>The Tropical Barrier is formed mainly by a climatic complex (probably a
change in temperature and rainfall) in the coastal region at or about
the latitude of Soto la Marina, where no geographic barrier is found.
In the western and central part of the Tropical Barrier, the climatic
factor is supported by a geographic factor. The Sierra Madre Oriental
is in the west and the Sierra de Tamaulipas is in the center. The
several mammals that are affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span> by this barrier are listed in the
accounts of the Veracruzian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces.</p>

<p>A peculiar pattern of distribution is that presented by <i>Scalopus
inflatus</i> and <i>Geomys tropicalis</i>. Both are the only known species of
their genera in northeastern México. Each is isolated from other
species of its genus. The nearest known record of <i>Scalopus</i> is 45
miles northward and the nearest record of <i>Geomys</i> is approximately 165
miles northward. A possible explanation for the distribution of these
two kinds is that each was widely distributed in one of the glacial
periods and when the glacier receded to the north these animals
remained in Tamaulipas, where they evolved and formed distinct species.
The two species, <i>G. tropicalis</i> and <i>S. inflatus</i>, are fossorial and
for this reason probably were able to resist inhospitable climates
better than non-burrowing species.</p>

<h2><a name="HISTORY_OF_MAMMALOGY" id="HISTORY_OF_MAMMALOGY"></a>HISTORY OF MAMMALOGY</h2>


<p>In Tamaulipas the first exploration directed in substantial measure
toward finding out about the mammalian fauna, at least as far as I
know, was made by Dr. L. Berlandier, who traveled mainly in the
northern half of the state. His collections provided specimens of
several previously unknown mammals, which were described by Baird
(1858). The original manuscript of Berlandier never has been published.
About 1880 Dr. E. Palmer collected mammals in the southern part of
Tamaulipas, in the area around Tampico. The results of his exploration
were reported by J. A. Allen (1881). E. W. Nelson and E. A. Goldman
twice collected in Tamaulipas (Goldman, 1951). In 1898 they visited and
collected mammals in the southern part of the state, around Tampico,
Altamira, Victoria, Forlón, and Miquihuana. In 1901-1902 they visited
the area between Nuevo Laredo and Bagdad, then went south to Soto la
Marina and Victoria. From their collections several species and
subspecies have been described. Between 1910 and the early 1920's
little was done in the way of scientific exploration because of the
Mexican Revolution.</p>

<p>From 1930 on, several expeditions yielded new information about the
native mammals. In that year L. B. Kellum visited the Sierra San
Carlos. The results were reported by Dice (1937). Another important
collection from Tamaulipas was made by Marian Martin in the area of
Gómez Farías. Mammals collected by her were reported by Goodwin (1954).
Hooper (1953) also reported specimens from Gómez Farías but included in
his report records of mammals collected in other areas as well. In 1950
E. R. Hall and C. von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span> Wedel made a trip to the barrier beach in the
northeastern part of the state and collected several kinds of mammals
among which three were described as new by Hall (1951).</p>

<p>The report here presented is based upon specimens in the Museum of
Natural History of The University of Kansas that were collected mainly
by the persons named beyond. Gerd H. Heinrich and his wife Hilda
collected in 1952 and 1953 in the areas around Miquihuana, Ciudad
Victoria, Soto la Marina, Sierra de Tamaulipas, and Altamira. W. J.
Schaldach collected in 1949 and 1950 in the Sierra Madre Oriental south
of Ciudad Victoria; he returned to Tamaulipas in 1954 in company with
V. Grissino and worked in the Sierra Madre Oriental south and north of
Ciudad Victoria. In 1961 P. L. Clifton and J. H. Bodley collected in
the northwestern part of the state and in the western part, around
Tula, Nicolás, and Tajada. Some students and staff members of the
Museum have occasionally collected in Tamaulipas.</p>

<p>As a result of all the mentioned expeditions and others, 32 species and
subspecies have been described with type localities in Tamaulipas. They
are:</p>

<h2><a name="CONSERVATION" id="CONSERVATION"></a>CONSERVATION</h2>


<p>A relatively large number of the species of Mexican big game occurs in
Tamaulipas because its geographic position permits it to have species
from the tropics and those from the northern plains and mountains.
Eight of the 11 Mexican species that are considered as Big Game are
recorded from the state. Until this century Tamaulipas was not densely
populated by man either in the pre-colonial period or thereafter.
Therefore many species of game are still relatively abundant.</p>

<p>Of the eight species that originally lived in Tamaulipas, the mule
deer, brocket, and black bear never have been abundant there and now
are in danger of extirpation. The pronghorn was also rare in the state
and now has been extirpated as it has been in many other parts of
México. The white-tailed deer, javalin, jaguar, and puma are still
abundant in suitable habitats. The white-tailed deer is found almost
everywhere in the state; in some areas it damages cornfields, and for
this reason is killed by natives who eat the meat and sell the skins.
The price of skins is low; in 1959 at Ciudad Mante tanners paid natives
less than one dollar (10.00 Mexican pesos) per hide. Some idea of the
abundance of deer in Tamaulipas is provided by our having found in one
tanner's shop, in 1959 at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span> Ciudad Mante, about 500 deer skins. Besides
these, we found about 65 skins of other species&mdash;jaguar, bear, ocelot,
puma, margay, and raccoon. Additionally there was a large number of
coati skins. Considering that México has no professional trappers and
that commerce in skins of wild animals is illegal, it is felt that the
number of skins found in the tanner's shop indicated a relative large
population of game mammals.</p>

<p>The number of species of small game also is large. Some species are
killed by natives for food, but most are killed in order to protect the
cultivated crops, which are injured mainly by rabbits and squirrels.</p>

<p>Baker (1958) pointed out that the future of the game species in the
northern part of México was not encouraging. He gave valid reasons for
his view. In Tamaulipas, however, in some respects the outlook is more
encouraging because there are many areas in which with a minimum of
effort the authorities can save a good number of species.</p>

<p>As Baker (<i>op. cit.</i>) remarked, the fauna in México is declining mainly
because many areas recently have been cultivated for the first time.
Also, better roads have enabled hunters to reach areas that formerly
were natural refuges for wild animals. Many times it has been said that
the populations of wild animals were declining in México because the
number of game wardens is too small to protect game in all parts of the
country. In some ways this is true but it seems that the problem is
really one of education. The people do not realize that the animals are
part of nature and therefore have the same right to live that man has.
Most people see only the bad side of the animals' activities and never
consider the benefit that wild mammals provide for man. A typical case
is that of the coyote, which is oftentimes killed only because it is a
coyote. Sometimes individual coyotes do kill domestic animals, but the
people seem never to understand that the coyote destroys a large number
of mice, rabbits, and insects as has been shown by studies of the
contents of coyote stomachs.</p>

<p>The Mexican Government at this time is making a concentrated effort to
provide schools in all parts of the country and is formulating new
programs of education. In this official program some lectures in
conservation are needed with reference to the animal life. I know that
some education now is given to people with respect to conservation of
the water, soil, and forest, but gather that there is little that
covers also conservation of animals.</p>

<p>I do not deny the necessity for some natives to kill wild animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
People need to eat fresh meat and for some it is almost impossible to
obtain meat in any other way than by killing wild animals. Some natives
cannot afford to purchase meat in the markets or they live too far from
any village or city to do so. Also, natives need to protect their
cultivated areas; some of them have only four to six acres of land, on
which corn is the only crop. When one deer in a night can destroy part
of the corn, and in some areas not only one deer but several invade a
field, and when one considers that besides deer there are rabbits,
squirrels, raccoons, and coati, to name only some animals that feed on
the corn, we find that the small cornfield at the end of the season may
not contain any corn to harvest. It is understandable, therefore, that
the natives kill the animals. In this way they protect their cultivated
fields, obtain food and sometimes money for the skins. Many natives,
however, destroy the wildlife only for pleasure or to obtain money for
skins and meat, which sometimes is sold to restaurants.</p>

<p>Probably the best solution for the problem of conservation of wild
animals is the establishment of wildlife refuges. In Tamaulipas, at
least three refuges are needed in order to preserve the mammalian
wildlife. These areas would serve also as a refuge for game birds and
other vertebrates. A large area with suitable habitat for white-tailed
deer, brocket, jaguar, puma, javalin, and fox could be established in
the Sierra de Tamaulipas, which presents favorable habitat for all of
the species named. A second area that does not need to be so large as
the first could be established in the Sierra Madre Oriental, probably
including some part of Nuevo León, where the black bear and the mule
deer find suitable habitat. Probably the beaver can be introduced in
the streams of the high mountains; beaver live in the same Sierra a
little farther north in Nuevo León. The three species mentioned are in
imminent danger of disappearing from Tamaulipas, if they have not
already disappeared. The third refuge could be in some area of the
northern part of the state near the Río Grande. This refuge should give
protection to the beaver&mdash;a rare animal in México and in danger of
extirpation over all the country. The pronghorn also would find
suitable habitat in this area, but would have to be reintroduced there.
With the establishment of these three refuges and with good management
the fauna of Tamaulipas could be saved from extinction, would provide
some recreation for sportsmen, and especially for the people in general
who wish to study, photograph, or merely observe the native animal
life.</p>

<p>The time is excellent for the establishment of the wildlife refuges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span> in
Tamaulipas because large areas are still in Federal ownership and
because a considerable number of animals remain. Other favorable
factors are that roads are not yet good in the areas proposed for
refuges, the human population is low, and agriculture consequently is
not practiced. But, with the rapid increase in population in México,
these favorable conditions will change in a few years and it will be
almost impossible to establish the refuges then.</p>

<h3>Didelphis marsupialis<br />

<span class="fwn">Opossum</span></h3>

<p>The opossum occurs throughout Tamaulipas but is commonest in the south,
especially in the areas of tropical forest and along water courses.
Most of the specimens examined were caught in steel traps baited with
remains of small animals (mostly mammals and birds, but one trap was
baited with the head of a black bass). At Villa Mainero five
individuals were caught in one night in five of seven traps scented
with spilogale musk. These traps were set in runways along a thick
thorn-brush fence, which separated a cornfield from thorn-brush desert.
Along the Río Purificación 36 kilometers north and 10 kilometers west
of Victoria an opossum was eaten in a trap by a small carnivore,
probably a felid judging from tracks around the trap.</p>

<p>A female with 14 pouch young was taken in June in the Sierra de
Tamaulipas and weighed 1350 grams; a March-taken female with nine small
young in her pouch, from Soto la Marina, weighed 1800 grams. A male
from the Sierra de Tamaulipas also weighed 1800 grams.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Southeastern part of state,
north at least to Soto la Marina.</p></div>

<p>In studying Tamaulipan specimens, I was mindful that Hershkovitz
(1951:550) regarded all opossums of this species in México as a single
subspecies, even though J. A. Allen (1901) recognized two subspecies in
the northeastern part of the Republic. According to Allen (p. 172), <i>D.
m. texensis</i> (to which he ascribed a distribution in Texas and
adjoining Tamaulipas) was described as: "Similar in coloration to <i>D.
marsupialis</i> (<i>typica</i>) [<i>D. m. californica</i>], but with a relatively
longer tail, longer nasals, usually terminating posteriorly in an acute
angle, instead of being rounded or more or less abruptly truncated on
the posterior border." The available material from Tamaulipas can be
divided into two groups on the basis of shape and proportion of the
nasals. In opossums from the southeast the nasals are truncate
posteriorly and average 47.0 (45.1-48.4) per cent of the condylobasal
length, whereas in specimens from elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span> the nasals are acute
posteriorly and average 50.7 (49.7-51.8) per cent of the condylobasal

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Known only from along eastern
side of Sierra Madre Oriental, north to vicinity of La
Purisima.</p></div>

<p>In Tamaulipas, the four-eyed opossum is seemingly common at relatively
low elevations in the Tropical Deciduous Forest along the eastern side
of the Sierra Madre Oriental, but the species is not restricted to this
area as one specimen is available from a place seven kilometers
southwest of La Purisima, in the drier forest of west-central
Tamaulipas. The highest elevation at which individuals have been taken
in the state is approximately 2500 feet.</p>

<p>Specimens obtained two kilometers west of El Carrizo were caught in
steel traps that were baited with the bodies of small birds and mammals
and that were set in trails leading through a fence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span> of piled logs that
separated a cornfield from adjacent forest. At Rancho Pano Ayuctle,
some individuals were trapped in steel sets baited with scraps of meat;
others were shot at night in the forest along the Río Sabinas.
Schaldach reported in his notes that four-eyed opossums robbed trap
lines set for small mammals at Rancho Pano Ayuctle. W. W. Dalquest
trapped an individual seven kilometers southwest of La Purisima using
the body of an armadillo as bait. The natives of southern Tamaulipas
refer to this animal as "tlacuache cuatrojos."</p>

<p>Tamaulipan specimens of <i>P. o. pallidus</i> differ from topotypes and
other specimens from the vicinity of the type locality in averaging
somewhat paler dorsally and slightly smaller in cranial dimensions when
specimens of equal age are compared. They differ also in having a
longer terminal area of white on the tail, 53.1 per cent (43.3-62.8) of
the length of the tail in 13 specimens from Tamaulipas, and 38.7
(30.9-48.2) per cent in 14 specimens from the vicinity of the type
locality of <i>pallidus</i> in Veracruz; specimens from northern Veracruz
are intermediate between the two mentioned populations in amount of
white on the tail. Baker (1951:210) noted that the specimens from two
kilometers west of El Carrizo had "proportionately longer tails than
typical <i>P. o. pallidus</i> from central Veracruz," but I do not find this
character to be consistent in the more abundant material now available.</p>

a cave near the headwaters of the Río Sabinas; along the same river at
Rancho Pano Ayuctle some were taken in a net stretched across a little
creek (arroyo). In the cave near El Encino the collector (Schaldach)

<p><i>Artibeus toltecus</i> is closely related to another species, <i>A.

lingually than in <i>aztecus</i>, in which the teeth are rounded. One of the
most important differences between these two species is that they occur
at different altitudes. Davis (1958:165) reported that <i>toltecus</i>
occurred at elevations below 5000 feet at more southerly localities in
México, whereas <i>aztecus</i> occurred above 5000 feet. In Tamaulipas the
two species probably have parallel distributions from south to north
but <i>A. toltecus</i> is known from Rancho Pano Ayuctle at an elevation of

<p>Most of the vampires examined in this study were taken in caves; those

Nine specimens were collected in a small cave 70 kilometers south of

the entrance; <i>Natalus stramineus</i> and <i>Glossophaga soricina</i> were
obtained from the same cave. In another cave only half a kilometer
distant, 12 males were collected. In Cueva La Mula, <i>Desmodus</i> was
found near the mouth, whereas <i>Choeronycteris mexicana</i> and two
<i>Tadarida brasiliensis</i> were collected in the deepest part. At Cueva La
Esperanza, 300 feet deep and on the east side of the Sierra Madre

<p>All specimens examined were obtained from caves. At Cueva la Esperanza,
approximately 400 individuals were found along with individuals of
<i>Desmodus rotundus</i>; <i>Natalus</i> and <i>Desmodus</i> also were collected
together in a cave approximately 30 yards deep three miles south and 14

<p>Tamaulipan specimens do not differ significantly in external or cranial
measurements in comparison with the specimens from Veracruz reported by

gray phase and are Avellaneus (grayish with yellowish hairs mixed)
instead of Clay Color as are specimens from Veracruz; those few in the
red phase are between Clay Color and Tawny-Olive instead of between
Burnt Sienna and Chestnut. By consequence, bats from Tamaulipas
resemble in color the smaller <i>N. s. mexicanus</i> of western México to a
greater degree than they resemble <i>N. s. saturatus</i>, but I follow
Goodwin (1959:7).</p>

<p>Judging from Hall and Kelson's (1959:185) distribution map for the
species, two subspecies, <i>E. f. fuscus</i> and <i>E. f. miradorensis</i>,
possibly occur in Tamaulipas, the former in the north and the latter in
the south. Comparison of specimens presently available from the state
(all from the southern part) with typical individuals of the two
subspecies mentioned reveal that they resemble <i>miradorensis</i> to a
greater degree than <i>fuscus</i> and they accordingly are assigned to the
former. In measurements, the Tamaulipan specimens agree closely with
<i>miradorensis</i>; in color, some resemble <i>miradorensis</i> but others

<p>At Rancho Pano Ayuctle, according to the field notes of the collector
(Schaldach), the red mastiff bat was common, and found daytime retreats
in hollows in cypress trees. Schaldach twice found groups of bats in
such hollows. <i>M. a. nigricans</i> is an early forager and most
individuals seen were in flight before sunset, usually flying in a more
or less straight line at heights of 25 to 60 feet above the ground. The
odor of the chest gland was described by Schaldach as "strong" and
"geranium-like." A female obtained three miles northeast of Guemes on
August 19 carried a single embryo that was 33 mm. in crown-rump length.</p>

<p>Specimens examined average slightly smaller than the type specimen,
especially in total length, length of hind foot, length of skull and
length of maxillary tooth-row. Davis (1951:219) also noted some of
these same differences in a specimen examined by him from two miles
south of Ciudad Victoria. The variation in color is great among
Tamaulipan specimens. Of the 15 examined, two are Dark Mummy Brown, six
are Mummy Brown, six are Sudan Brown, and one is paler than Sudan
Brown.</p>

<p>In Tamaulipas this squirrel is called "ardilla chica" or "ardilla
barcina," and is abundant in areas where tall trees and dense brush
prevail. This species evidently does not have restricted periods of
activity, as does <i>S. aureogaster</i>, but is active throughout the day.
At El Carrizo a nest, nine to 10 inches in diameter and constructed of
leaves and small sticks, was in a thick tangle of branches 25 feet
above the ground. A male having testes 11 mm. long was in the nest.
Among 16 females collected in the months of February, May and June,
only two, taken in February, were lactating. A female from 70
kilometers south of Ciudad Victoria, had four placental scars, three on
the right side and one on the left, along with a resorbed embryo on the
right side; according to the collector "the scars appeared quite
recent, as evidenced by the fact that not all of the blood had been
resorbed yet."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Known only from vicinity of

<p><i>Geomys tropicalis</i> was named as a subspecies of <i>G. personatus</i> in
1915 by E. A. Goldman. To my knowledge, no one other than Goldman has
critically studied specimens of this pocket gopher, nor have specimens
other than those listed in the original description been reported up to
now. In 1953, Gerd H. Heinrich collected a series of 19 individuals one
mile south of Altamira. These specimens were compared (by E. R. Hall in
March, 1962) with the holotype and paratypes of <i>G. p. tropicalis</i> and
were found to be indistinguishable.</p>

<p>Careful comparisons of the specimens from one mile south of Altamira
with topotypes of <i>G. personatus personatus</i> (and specimens of other
subspecies) indicate that <i>tropicalis</i> differs from <i>personatus</i> in a
number of important characters, some of which <i>tropicalis</i> shares with
<i>Geomys arenarius</i> of the Rio Grande Valley and adjacent areas in
Texas, New Mexico, and Chihuahua (see Table 2).</p>

<p>As can be seen in the accompanying table <i>tropicalis</i> resembles
<i>arenarius</i> in half of the eight characters considered, especially in
the presence of a knob on the zygomatic process of the squamosal (the
diagnostic character of <i>arenarius</i> according to Merriam, 1895:140) and
in the shape of the mesopterygoid fossa. <i>G. tropicalis</i> differs from
<i>arenarius</i> principally in having a low sagittal crest in adult males
(lacking in <i>arenarius</i>) and in the shape of the interparietal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span> bone,
which in <i>tropicalis</i> is small (in some skulls difficult to see) and
triangular instead of being relatively large and subquadrate as in
<i>arenarius</i>.</p>

<p><i>G. tropicalis</i> resembles <i>personatus</i> in half of the characters
considered, notably in shape of the interparietal bone, outline of
zygomatic arches, and constriction of the premaxillae where they border
the incisive foramina.</p>

<p>Considering the distinctive combination of characters possessed by
<i>tropicalis</i>, and its isolated, restricted geographic range (the
nearest known record of <i>Geomys</i> is approximately 165 miles to the
north), <i>tropicalis</i> is here regarded as a full species. A skull alone
examined from 10 miles northwest of Tampico does not differ from those
of other specimens studied.</p>

The difference in size is reflected in the weights. Average weights of
nine males and nine females from southern localities are, respectively,

<h3>Liomys irroratus<br />

<span class="fwn">Mexican Spiny Pocket Mouse</span></h3>

<p>This species is probably the most common rodent in Tamaulipas. It was
taken at almost every locality sampled and was associated with many
other kinds of rodents. Its distribution is state-wide with the
exception of the extreme northwestern part. Two subspecies are
represented in Tamaulipas, <i>L. i. alleni</i>, which occurs in the western
side of the Sierra Madre Oriental in the southwest part of the state,
and <i>L. i. texensis</i>, which occupies the rest of the range of the
species in the state.</p>

<p>At Soto la Marina specimens were taken in dense brush, around the
cultivated fields; no burrows were seen and all specimens were trapped
before 10:00 p.m. On the Sierra de Tamaulipas, <i>Liomys</i> was collected
in practically all microhabitats. In the vicinity of San Fernando,
individuals were trapped in a dry area in which vegetation consisted of
mesquite, cactus and chollas; the ground there was covered with dry
leaves and small sticks, and burrows were found near the base of the
mesquite bushes. One specimen was taken near the house of a woodrat.
Two kilometers west of El Carrizo, where <i>Liomys irroratus</i> is called
"ratón tuza," specimens were collected on rocks inclined at an angle of
about twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span> degrees that were covered with zacatón grass and
some bushes. Some individuals were taken in a sugar cane field that was
surrounded by bushes and tall grass; <i>Baiomys taylori</i>, <i>Sigmodon
hispidus</i>, and <i>Peromyscus leucopus</i> were taken in the line of traps.
One specimen was caught in a trap baited with banana.</p>

<p>Some dates concerning reproduction of <i>Liomys irroratus</i> in Tamaulipas
are as follows: La Pesca, May 25, one female lactating and one female
pregnant with 4 embryos that measured 8 mm.; Jaumave, July 26-29, three
females lactating and three pregnant females that carried 6 embryos (6
mm.), 6 embryos (15 mm.), and 5 embryos (15 mm.); Palmillas, July 23, a
female with 1 embryo measuring 6 mm.; Nicolás, October 19, a female
carrying 4 embryos measuring 3 mm.</p>

<p>This subspecies is easily distinguished from <i>L. i. texensis</i> by the
following features: hind foot larger, 31.5 (30-33.5) instead of 27.8
(27-29); skull longer, 34.2 (32.4-36.4) instead of 31.5 (30.0-32.5);
maxillary tooth-row longer, 5.4 (5.0-5.8) instead of 5.0 (4.8-5.1);
interorbital constriction relatively narrower in <i>alleni</i>.
Intergradation between <i>L. i. alleni</i> and <i>L. i. texensis</i> takes place
at Rancho Santa Rosa (where, of the two specimens, one is conspicuously
larger than the other), eight kilometers northeast of Antiguo Morelos,
El Encino, and Ejido Santa Isabel. All specimens from the localities
mentioned are here assigned to <i>texensis</i>.</p>

<p>Weight of three pregnant females averaged 68.9 (64-78) grams, that of

<h3>Oryzomys palustris<br />

<span class="fwn">Marsh Rice Rat</span></h3>

<p>Previous to this report only one subspecies of <i>Oryzomys palustris</i> had

material from the state shows that <i>O. p. aquaticus</i> occurs in the east
and <i>O. p. peragrus</i> lives in the southwestern part of the state.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span></p>

<p>In general, specimens examined were trapped in dense brush alongside
waterholes as at Altamira, or around cornfields as at the place 36
kilometers north and 10 kilometers west of Ciudad Victoria, where the
bushes were mesquite and other kinds of Acacias. There the ground was
covered by cat claw, and no grass was seen near the traps in which <i>O.
palustris</i> was caught. In the Sierra de Tamaulipas a specimen was
caught among rocks and bushes. Ingles (1959:395) reported that his
specimens were trapped alive in dense brush and "tules."</p>

<p>A female taken at Jaumave on July 25 had 5 embryos, each 20 mm. in

<p>Most records of <i>O. p. peragrus</i> are from places along the Sierra Madre

(1951:215) reported two specimens from two different localities labeled
with reference to Ciudad Victoria (same specimens reported here) as <i>O.
p. aquaticus</i>, but pointed out that they tended "toward the darker <i>O.

consideration the relation between the interorbital constriction and
the greatest length of skull, cause me here to refer those specimens to

<h3>Oryzomys melanotis<br />

<span class="fwn">Black-eared Rice Rat</span></h3>

<p><i>Oryzomys melanotis</i> occurs in Tamaulipas from Soto la Marina
southward. Two subspecies are recorded: <i>O. m. carrorum</i> in the north
and <i>O. m. rostratus</i> in the tropical area from Rancho Pano Ayuctle to
Altamira.</p>

<p>Specimens from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were trapped along a stream,
edged with trees, bushes and rocks; at Rancho Pano Ayuctle the animals
were in grass between banana groves. The specimen from 70 kilometers
south of Ciudad Victoria was taken in tall grass near a field of sugar
cane in a line of traps that yielded also <i>Peromyscus leucopus</i>,
<i>Sigmodon hispidus</i>, <i>Liomys irroratus</i>, and <i>Oryzomys fulvescens</i>.
Hooper (1953:8) and Ingles (1959:395) reported <i>O. melanotis</i> as caught
at the edges of cane fields.</p>

<p>The original description of this subspecies was based on three
specimens collected at Rancho Santa Ana. Specimens examined from the
Sierra de Tamaulipas extended the known range 45 miles southeast of the
type locality, and also extend the previously known altitudinal range
of 300-350 feet elevation to 1200 feet.</p>

<p>Specimens examined correspond in color and measurements to those
recorded by Lawrence (1947:102-103). Of 12 specimens studied, the
tympanic bullae of six touch the surface of the table when the skull
rests on the tips of the incisors and the occipital condyles. In the
other six the bullae are 0.3 to 1.3 mm. above the table top. The
mesopterygoid space in the specimens examined are broad and U-shaped
and not V-shaped as in the three specimens examined by Lawrence (<i>op.

<span class="fwn">Fulvous Harvest Mouse</span></h3>

<p>This is the most common species of <i>Reithrodontomys</i> in Tamaulipas; it
occurs in almost all parts of the state, from sea level to high up in
the mountains and from the tropical forest to the desert plain.</p>

<p>The three subspecies in the state are <i>R. f. intermedias</i> in the
northern half, <i>R. f. griseoflavus</i> in the high parts of the Sierra
Madre Oriental, and <i>R. f. tropicalis</i> in the southeast. The lines
between these subspecies are difficult to establish because the zones
of intergradation are broad. Characters for separating the three
subspecies in Tamaulipas are listed by Hooper (1952).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Over all of state.</p></div>

<p>This is the most common species of the genus <i>Peromyscus</i> in
Tamaulipas. It and <i>Liomys irroratus</i> are the two rodents most easily
trapped throughout the state. In general <i>P. l. texanus</i> occurs in
forested and brushy areas especially under 1200 feet in elevation, as
was noted in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, where <i>P. l. texanus</i> was taken
commonly at elevations of up to 1200 feet. Above this elevation the
species was rare and <i>P. pectoralis</i> and <i>P. boylii</i> were more abundant
than at lower elevations. The three specimens of <i>P. l. texanus</i> from
12 kilometers north and four kilometers west of Ciudad Victoria were
trapped in a line of 110 traps set near tree stumps. Small burrows in
the ground were noted here. The forest at this locality was composed of
mesquite, ebony, acacias, a few yuccas and "nopales" (= cactuses); the
ground was covered by cat claw.</p>

<p>Of the many young taken, 15 specimens were saved from Ejido Santa
Isabel where <i>P. leucopus</i> was abundant in an area of chaparral
consisting of wild "tomate," "zapote," "huizache" and "salvadora." Most
of the specimens caught at this locality were taken between 7:30 and
9:30 p. m. in traps baited with a mixture of rolled oats, peanut butter
and banana. Specimens from 53 kilometers north of El Limón were taken
along with <i>Liomys irroratus</i>; the specimen from two kilometers west of
El Carrizo was trapped near a dead mesquite log. <i>Reitrodontomys
fulvescens</i> was taken in the same area. Four specimens of <i>P. leucopus</i>
were taken at Rancho Pano Ayuctle, around a big pile of old firewood in
an abandoned sugar mill. At the locality six miles north and six miles
west of Altamira, <i>P. leucopus</i> was found in cultivated fields and
along the grassy roadsides; in the vicinity of Tampico specimens were
taken in an area of forested cactus-thorn. The specimen from seven
kilometers south and two kilometers west of San Fernando was found in a
trap set at the base of "nopal" cactus, which was surrounded by bushes
and small trees (10-12 feet high).</p>

<p>Breeding records are as follows: Rancho Pano Ayuctle, on February 15,
one female carried 2 embryos of 23 mm. in crown-rump length; Jaumave,
July 26 to 29, five females, averaging 4.6 (3-6) embryos of 7 (3-15)
mm., two females lactating, one on May 25 and the other on July 26;
Ejido Santa Isabel, on January 20 to 25, three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span> females lactating; Soto
la Marina, on May 16, one female lactating.</p>

<p>Average weights were as follows: from Jaumave four pregnant females,
28.0 (25-33), eight males, 23.4 (21-27); from the Sierra de Tamaulipas,
eight females non-pregnant, 21.2 (18-26), 14 males, 22.0 (19-27); from
6 mi. N, 6 mi. W Altamira, six males, 23.5 (21-27).</p>

<p>All specimens examined from Tamaulipas are assigned to <i>P. l. texanus</i>
because their coloration is pale. Even so the color varies some
according to locality; specimens from Rancho Pano Ayuctle and the
Sierra de Tamaulipas have much of the cinnamon color that is
characteristic of <i>P. l. incensus</i> from farther south, but even so
specimens from the two localities last mentioned are paler than those
from Veracruz that are typical <i>incensus</i>.</p>

<p>Goldman (1942:158) reported specimens from Altamira as <i>P. l.
incensus</i>, in which subspecies Ingles (1959:397) included specimens
from two miles west of Tampico, but specimens examined from the same
area do not differ from individuals from far north thereof; for this
reason I identify specimens from these localities as <i>texanus</i>. Osgood
(1909:131) and Hooper (1953:7) also referred specimens from the
southern part of Tamaulipas to <i>texanus</i>. These two authors examined
156 specimens and did not find any intergradation between <i>texanus</i> and
<i>incensus</i>, but to me, the cinnamon tones of specimens from Rancho Pano
Ayuctle and the Sierra de Tamaulipas, suggest intergradation between
the two subspecies.</p>

<p>Osgood's (1909:265) measurements of <i>P. l. texanus</i>, from Brownsville,
Texas, and those of 40 specimens from different localities in
Tamaulipas are about the same except that the anterior palatine
foramina average longer in Tamaulipas. Baker's (1956:262) specimens
from Coahuila, averaged larger even than Tamaulipan specimens. Another
difference between Osgood's measurements and Baker's was the shorter
3.4 (3.0-3.7) maxillary tooth-row in Tamaulipan specimens.</p>

<p>Hooper (1953:7) recorded specimens from General Terán, as in
Tamaulipas; actually this locality is in Nuevo León.</p>

<h3>Peromyscus pectoralis<br />

<span class="fwn">White-ankled Mouse</span></h3>

<p><i>Peromyscus pectoralis</i> and <i>P. boylii</i> are closely related
morphologically and seem to occupy the same habitat. In the Sierra
Madre Oriental, according to the field notes of the collector
(Heinrich, June 6 to August 5, 1953), individuals of <i>P. pectoralis</i>
had a pinkish coloration on the mouth and forefeet produced by the
juice of the "nopal" cactus fruit, on which obviously the mice feed,
whereas only a few specimens of <i>boylii</i> were thus discolored. It was
noted that <i>boylii</i> was feeding on acorns. Furthermore, the two species
may differ in time of breeding; in August, males of <i>pectoralis</i> had
the testes well developed when those organs were small in <i>boylii</i>
collected at the same locality.</p>

<p>A specimen from 53 kilometers north of El Limón, was shot at a height
of 10 feet on a concrete underpass. Other specimens were taken in a
trap line that yielded <i>Peromyscus boylii</i>, <i>P. leucopus</i> and <i>Liomys
irroratus</i>.</p>

<p>Two subspecies of <i>P. pectoralis</i> occur in Tamaulipas: <i>P. p. collinus</i>
is widely distributed in the central and western parts of the state and
<i>P. p. eremicoides</i> occurs only in the western "corner" of the state.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Along the central and western

<p>A female obtained on January 21 at a place 53 kilometers north of El
Limón, contained three embryos. A lactating female was taken on August
2 in the Sierra Madre Oriental. Males, as previously noted, had
well-developed testes in August. The weights of 17 males and 20 females
from the Sierra de Tamaulipas were, respectively, 26.6 (24-33), and
25.6 (21-31) grams.</p>

<p>Measurements of specimens from different localities in Tamaulipas
averaged about the same, except that those of specimens from Palmillas,
averaged smaller. The small size suggests intergradation between the
subspecies <i>collinus</i> and <i>eremicoides</i>. The latter occurs to the west
and differs from <i>collinus</i> in smaller size, more grayish coloration,
completely white tarsal joint and relatively longer tail. Hooper
(1952:374) reported specimens from Jaumave as intergrades between the
two subspecies before mentioned and Osgood (1909:164) identified two
specimens from there as <i>eremicoides</i>. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span> present account,

were taken in junglelike forest among rocks and adjacent to logs.
Burrows extended beneath large blocks of limestone, and each burrow
where a mouse was caught was marked by a pile of excavated earth
resembling a tiny mound left by a pocket gopher. These burrows were at
an elevation of approximately 2800 feet above sea level on the steep
sides of a small hill in an area where the vegetation was intermediate

<h3>Sigmodon hispidus<br />

<p>This species, as is known, is active by day and by night. It occurs
mainly in grassy areas and most of the specimens examined were trapped
there. But, one mile east of La Pesca, specimens were taken on a beach
having sparse grass. <i>Neotoma micropus</i> and <i>Spermophilus spilosoma</i>,
but no smaller rodents, were taken there. Also, many crabs were found
in the traps. Possibly only the relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span> large rodents are able to
compete successfully with the crabs. The specimen from one kilometer
east of El Barretal was caught in a rat-trap set in front of small hole
in a fence of dead brush that surrounded a cornfield. The area outside
the fence supported mesquite and ebony trees (10-12 feet high) and the
ground was covered with cat claw. Six miles north and six miles west of
Altamira, the two young specimens were taken on a small grassy island
surrounded by mud.</p>

<p>According to natives, <i>Sigmodon</i> injures corn and sugar cane. Probably
other species of rodents are responsible for some or all of such damage
since other kinds of rodents were taken in the same areas.</p>

<p>Dice (1937:245) reported females from the Sierra San Carlos that

<p>Baker (1951:216) reported a specimen from 35 kilometers north and 10
kilometers west of Ciudad Victoria (= 1 km. E El Barretal) as <i>S. h.
toltecus</i>. Comparison of its skull with those from the vicinity of
Altamira (<i>S. h. toltecus</i>) and those from Jaumave (<i>S. h.
berlandieri</i>) shows that the skull from El Barretal closely resembles
those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span> from Jaumave, in having the zygomatic arches more nearly
parallel and the braincase more rounded than in skulls from Altamira.

<h3>Neotoma angustapalata <span class="fwn">Baker</span><br />

<span class="fwn">Tamaulipas Wood Rat</span></h3>

<p class="i3">1951. <i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> Baker, Univ. Kansas Publ.,
Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:217, December 15, type from 70 km. by
highway S Ciudad Victoria, and 6 km. W Pan-American highway
at El Carrizo, Tamaulipas.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Southern part of state;
presently known from two localities.</p></div>

<p>Baker (1951:218) reported that specimens from the type locality were
taken in crevices among rocks on a small hillside that supported a
sparse cover of vegetation growing from a deep layer of humus. The
specimen from eight kilometers west and 10 kilometers north of El
Encino was shot about 40 yards from the entrance to a large cave, but
no sign of wood rats were found there. Hooper (1953:9) reported that
<i>N. angustapalata</i> occupied caves at Rancho del Cielo, where a female
with two nursing young was taken.</p>

<p>When Baker (<i>op. cit.</i>) described <i>Neotoma angustapalata</i> on the basis
of two specimens from El Carrizo, he assigned the species to the <i>N.
mexicana</i> group because of the deep anterointernal re-entrant angle of
M1. The deep angle found in <i>N. mexicana</i> differs markedly from the
typical condition in either <i>N. micropus</i> or <i>N. albigula</i>. Study of
the cranial characters and bacula of specimens of <i>N. micropus</i> and <i>N.
angustapalata</i> tends to corroborate the statement of Hooper (1953:10),
who commented on the taxonomic relationships of <i>N. angustapalata</i> as
follows: "It should be pointed out that all characters considered ...
the specimens [<i>angustapalata</i>] appear to be large, deeply pigmented
examples of the species <i>N. micropus</i> notwithstanding the deep anterior
fold in M1. The presence of that deep fold is far from an absolute
character in the <i>mexicanus</i> [<i>sic</i>] group."</p>

<p>My study of 48 crania of <i>N. micropus</i> from Tamaulipas reveals that the
depth of the re-entrant angle of M1 is extremely variable, from almost
absent in some individuals to deep (as in <i>angustapalata</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span> in others.
Four specimens, one (56958) from the Sierra de Tamaulipas and three
(56960, 56965, 56966) from the vicinity of Altamira, have the
re-entrant angle as deep as in the holotype and topotype of
<i>angustapalata</i>.</p>

<p>Comparison of the bacula of the holotype and one topotype of
<i>angustapalata</i> with 15 bacula of <i>N. micropus</i> reveal that on the
average the baculum of <i>angustapalata</i> differs from that of <i>micropus</i>
in being longer, and narrower at the base (greatest length, 7.1, width
at base, 3.4 mm., in the topotype). One specimen of <i>N. micropus
littoralis</i> from the vicinity of Altamira, however, has a baculum of
the same shape as in <i>angustapalata</i> (this same specimen is one of the
three from there in which the re-entrant angle of the M1 is deep). The
shape of the baculum among specimens of <i>micropus</i> is highly variable
and bacula of specimens from different localities frequently are
slightly different (see <a href="#fig5">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The known distributions of <i>N. micropus</i> and <i>N. angustapalata</i> do not
overlap (neither does the distribution of <i>N. albigula</i> overlap with
either in Tamaulipas). The four specimens of <i>N. micropus</i> having the
deep re-entrant angle in M1 are from localities near where the ranges
of <i>angustapalata</i> and <i>micropus</i> probably meet. This could be
interpreted in two ways: (1) these four specimens can be regarded as
intergrades between <i>angustapalata</i> and <i>micropus</i>, in which case the
former species should be placed as a subspecies of the latter. Or the
four specimens, which were collected along with other specimens that
lack deep re-entrant angles in the M1, can be assigned, on the basis of
the deep angle, to <i>angustapalata</i>, in which case the species
<i>micropus</i> and <i>angustapalata</i> would be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span> part sympatric. Until more
material from critical areas is available for study, I continue to
recognize <i>angustapalata</i> as a monotypic species. I agree with Hooper
that it is closely related to <i>N. micropus</i>.</p>

specimens are referred to <i>C. l. microdon</i> on the basis of their dark
color and dusky shading on the throat and chest. One has a rufous
over-all color and the other is ochraceous yellowish. This difference
in color suggests intergradation at this place between <i>C. l. microdon</i>

<p>The specimen from the Sierra Madre Oriental was obtained by a collector
who used a rabbit call. Leopold (1959:408) reported that the highest
elevation [about 2800 feet] at which he found gray fox in México was at
Hacienda de Acuña, in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, where "dense, brushy
draws and oak openings made ideal habitat." At this place Leopold saw,
in early August, a family of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span> foxes, four well-grown young and their

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Distribution in Tamaulipas.</i>&mdash;Western half of state.</p></div>

<p>The two specimens examined provide the second record of this species in
Tamaulipas; they were shot in the bottom of an arid canyon. One animal
was about 30 feet up from the ground in an oak tree, and the other was
along a small arroyo containing pools of water.</p>

<p>From Rhoads' paper (1893:416-417) on the genus <i>Bassariscus</i> it would
seem that <i>B. astutus flavus</i> differs from <i>B. a. astutus</i> in smaller
size, especially of the skull, shorter tail (shorter than head and body
in <i>flavus</i> and longer than head and body in <i>astutus</i>) and the
presence of fulvous color. Comparison of 10 specimens of <i>B. a. flavus</i>
from Coahuila and Texas with two of <i>B. a. astutus</i> (Distrito Federal,
1; Las Vigas, Veracruz, 1) from central México reveals that the skulls
do not differ qualitatively and that the skull of <i>flavus</i> tends to be
smaller and relatively wider, but that there is overlap in size. In all
<i>flavus</i> that I measured and in the two adults of <i>astutus</i> the tail is
shorter than the head and body. The only real difference is the color;
ringtails from Texas are deep fulvous instead of grayish as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
<i>astutus</i> from the Distrito Federal and Veracruz. But the specimen from
Veracruz has much fulvous and on the other hand specimens from Coahuila
are more grayish than those from Texas.</p>

<p>The two specimens from Tamaulipas can be assigned to either subspecies
<i>astutus</i> or <i>flavus</i> with almost equal propriety. Here they are
referred to <i>B. a. flavus</i> on the basis of their relatively small
skull, short tail, and presence of some fulvous color.</p>

postorbital process is longer and more pointed, and the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>

<p>The specimen from Jaumave is clearly <i>M. f. frenata</i>, but the other
from northwest of Altamira has many characters of the subspecies <i>M. f.
tropicalis</i> and is an intergrade between the two subspecies. In cranial
features and in measurements the animal is like <i>frenata</i>. For example:
least width of palate more than length of P4; distance between anterior
border of auditory bulla and foramen ovale equal to the width of four
(including I3) upper incisors; depth of tympanic bulla less than
distance between it and foramen ovale; length of tail amounting to 82
per cent of length of head and body. The coloration is more nearly like
that of <i>tropicalis</i>. For example, the region between the ears and the
region behind the ears as far as the shoulders is almost black; hairs
of the soles of the forefeet are of the same color as in <i>tropicalis</i>.
But, width of the whitish underparts amounts to 53 per cent of the
circumference of the body; in this respect the specimen is like

<p>Hall and Kelson (1959:961) reported from Tamaulipas two subspecies of
<i>Felis pardalis</i>. According to Goldman (1943:379) the more northern of
the two, <i>F. p. albescens</i>, is smaller than the more southern one, <i>F.
p. pardalis</i>. The skull examined, of a young female,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span> from 10 miles
north of Altamira, in southern Tamaulipas, is small, smaller even than
skulls of <i>albescens</i> from Texas used in comparison. For this reason I
here assign the specimen examined to <i>F. p. albescens</i> instead of <i>F.
p. pardalis</i> as did Hall and Kelson (<i>op. cit.</i>). Hooper (1953:4) and
Dice (1937:251) report as <i>F. p. pardalis</i> specimens from 10 miles
northeast of Zamorina and others from the Sierra San Carlos. I assume
that specimens from these two places should be referred to <i>albescens</i>
since the specimen from 10 miles north of Altamira, the southernmost
locality represented in Tamaulipas, is here referred to <i>albescens</i>.</p>

<p>I am sure that the pronghorn is extinct in Tamaulipas, but its
occurrence in the northern part of the state in relatively recent time
(more than 100 years ago) seems possible because the habitat in
northern Tamaulipas is suitable for the pronghorn.</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

Gutenberg-tm License.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
